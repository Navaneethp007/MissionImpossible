<h2>Welcome aboard Competitive programmers.......</h2>
 
 
This is a repo where you can submit/find solutions of various competitive programming questions solved mostly in cpp but all programming languages are welcome. The folders which are used in the repo are:
 - CodeChef
 - LeetCode
 - CodeForces
 - Random (special)

In the CodeChef folder, the solutions of CodeChef questions are stored with their <i>problem code</i> as name of the file. Contributors are supposed to find solutions to questions in CodeChef platform and create a PR with <b><i>"problem_code.language_used"</i></b> as the name.

In the LeetCode/Codeforces folder, the solutions of LeetCode questions are stored with their <i>problem name</i> as name of the file. Contributors are supposed to find solutions to questions in LeetCode/Codeforces platform and create a PR with <b><i>"problem_name.language_used"</i></b> as the name.

The specials are a bit different:
- In Random folder, simple coding questions are given. The contributors have to find the solutions to the questions by creating a <b><i>"sol <question_number>.language_used "</b></i> and create a PR to that folder.

Before making pull requests makes sure to read the <strong><a href="https://github.com/Navaneethp007/MissionImpossible/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing Guidelines</a></strong> and also check for issues with <i>"hactoberfest" label</i>.
